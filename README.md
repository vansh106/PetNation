# PetNation
We created an application which will help stray animals. A platform which will allow a user to upload stray animals near their surroundings and adopt or donate for other stray animals in their city.\n
## Donation-Concept
We are introducing a currency named "petCoin". We are creating a centralized donation system. Users will pay us real money and they will get petCoins accordingly. Users can use these petCoins to donate to other animals Or they can buy food for stray animals from stores ( will be explained in next para).<br/>
### Why this donation system is complex?
If a person gets real money as a donation from someone, he/she will may use it for his/her own use. This way a normal donation system will flop immediately. In this case, petCoins will work only with pet stores and hospitals. We will tie up with pet stores/hospitals which will accept petcoins and provide service and at the end of the month we will pay stores/hospitals according to the petCoins they earned. Initially we will implement our idea in a big city like indore.<br/>
**Delivery Feature**<br/>
Many people dont have time to actually go and buy food for stray animals. So we will introduce online delivery system of pet food by tying up with delivery company. User will have to pay extra delivery charges for it ( with real money).
